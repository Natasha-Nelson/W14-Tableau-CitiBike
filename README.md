# W14-Tableau-CitiBike

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore CitiBike ride data from August 2019 to draw conclusions about best practices for operating a bike rideshare company. This analysis can be used as part of a broader project to pitch similar companies/business models in other areas outside of New York City. In this analysis, I will be drawing conclusions from visualizations in Tableau to answer the following questions:
  1. Who are the customers for bike shares?
  2. How long are bikes checked out and when? 
  3. Where should bikes be placed and where do they end up?
  4. When should bikes be maintained?

## Results

### Customer Profiles
In this first section we examined the breakdown between subscribers and one time customers, female/male/'gender unknown' riders and the age of riders. From these figures we can conclude the majority of riders in August are male. We can also observe that in both the female and male demographic, trips from subscribers outweight those of single customers. We can also see a trend in rider age that peaks between 20-35. 

## Conclusions 
From the customer profile, we observed that the majority of rides were made by subscribers to the ridership service, suggesting that regular use of bikes by commuters may outweight usage by tourists. This means we can rely on high traffic commuting areas to gain traction in new cities. We can also see an unusual spike of riders with a birth year of 1970 with a high number of 'gender unknown' records. It would be worth exploring this segment further to ensure a clean data set.
